**wetSAXS**
C++ program for calculating small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profiles from atomic coordinates in PDB format.  The program uses the NNLS code from Suvrit Sra, the frsc directory for ensemble fitting.  

#Build Requirements
Boost c++ library 1.86 or greater
SASTools (https://github.com/rambor/SASTools)

On a MAC, I would build boost and SAStools using a homebrew install of gcc, libaries are built static.
